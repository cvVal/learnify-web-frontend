# Learning App

Welcome to my personal project, a learning application that provides access to a variety of courses for eager learners. Please note that all the information within this application is mock data.

## Project Overview

This project represents the culmination of my efforts, where I've designed and developed the application from scratch. With a 'mobile-first' approach in mind, this app is crafted to adapt seamlessly to both mobile and desktop devices.

## Key Technologies Used

- **Vite**: The lightning-fast build tool for web development.
- **React**: A widely-used JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## Backend Integration

I've also taken care of the backend, having designed and implemented it entirely from the ground up. This ensures that the application's functionality is fully supported by a robust backend architecture.
